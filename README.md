## Blogs

### [Introduction to Prometheus](https://medium.com/@hassannawaz69/understanding-prometheus-8e567bfdbfef)

In this blog, I explored how Prometheus serves as a powerful monitoring tool in cloud-native environments, offering simplicity and robust querying capabilities.

**Key Highlights:**

- **Core Components**: Prometheus Server, Alertmanager, Pushgateway, Exporters, PromQL, Service Discovery, and Grafana.
- **Declarative Configuration**: Easily define scrape targets and intervals in a `prometheus.yml` file.
- **Streamlined Monitoring**: Automatically discovers and scrapes metrics from configured targets.
- **Real-World Use Case**: Step-by-step guide to setting up Prometheus and monitoring system metrics.

### [Docker Swarm vs Kubernetes: Choosing the Right Orchestration Tool](https://medium.com/@hassannawaz69/docker-swarm-vs-kubernetes-afcd89a76879)

In this blog, I explored how orchestration tools like Docker Swarm and Kubernetes help automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containers, and how to choose the right one for your project.

**Key Highlights:**

- **Docker Swarm**: 
  - Native clustering tool for Docker containers.
  - Easy to set up and manage.
  - Ideal for smaller projects and teams familiar with Docker.

- **Kubernetes**: 
  - Open-source platform for complex deployments.
  - Offers advanced features like automatic scaling and self-healing.
  - Suitable for large-scale, long-term production environments.

- **Comparison**:
  - Docker Swarm is simpler and fits straightforward deployments.
  - Kubernetes provides more features and scalability for complex environments.
